An online 'missed contraceptive pill' decision tool.

Why?
It can be very difficult to remember to take a pill every day. If a pill is missed, it can 
be difficult to find out exactly what to do next and whether you are still protected
by contraception. 

The online decision tool will take inputs such as name/brand of contraception, how many hours 
since they last took the pill, how many pills are left in the packet and when the user last had sex.
The output from this information will be instructions on what to do next e.g. 'Take missed 
pill and next pill at the same time.'
